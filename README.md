> - It is developed by **Google** first released in **2011**.
> - It was designed as an alternative to **JavaScript** to run apps in the browser but it was never embraced as such by the Web Dev community.
> - However it got its comeback after being adopted as the language for **Flutter** framework becoming one of the most loved programming language in the industry
> - It is unique for its ability to compile to multiple target architectures like **arm and x64** machine code for **Mobile Devices**, **JavaScript** for **Web** and Self-Contained **Executables** for **Windows, Mac OS and Linux**.

<h3> Dart CLI </h3>

1. <h5>To Start a New Dart Project, we will be using a command-line application template</h5>

 ```bash
dart create -t console-simple project_name
```
2. <h5> We need to navigate the 'bin' (stands for binary) directory where the actual source code is in </h5>

```bash
cd bin
```
3. <h5> To run the given program 'dart.dart' </h5>

```bash
dart run
```
  <h6> Usually to run a specific program inside the bin, we add the name as well </h5>

```bash
dart run program_name.dart
```
4. <h5> Aside from running, the cli can also compile your code to certain targets </h5>
